## Core Concepts
Before diving into the project, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with some core concepts of JavaScript and React.

## JavaScript Core Concepts

### Immutability vs Mutability
Understanding how and when to apply these principles in JavaScript can significantly influence the performance and manageability of your code.

### JavaScript Objects
Objects are key-value stores that are widely used in JavaScript. Mastery of objects is crucial in manipulating data and structuring your code.

### Lists and Map Method
Knowledge of arrays and how to utilize the map method will greatly assist in handling data and generating elements in React.

## React Core Concepts
### React Components
These are the building blocks of any React application. They help in creating custom and reusable HTML elements.

### React Component Lifecycle and Rendering
Learn about the various lifecycle methods and when React decides to re-render components.

### The Virtual DOM 
Understand how React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve application performance.

### Props
Props are arguments passed into React components. They are used to pass data from parent to child components.

### Hooks
Learn about React Hooks, which allow you to use state and other features of React without writing a class.

###useState Hook
This Hook allows you to add React state to functional components.

### useEffect Hook
This Hook lets you perform side effects in functional components.

### useRef Hook
The useRef Hook allows you to access and interact with DOM elements directly.

### Lifting State Up
This is a common pattern in React where state is placed in a parent component so that it can be shared between child components.

### Styling in React
There are various ways to style React components, including inline styles, CSS Modules, and using CSS in JS libraries.

## Libraries
Get to know the following libraries that are extensively used in this project:

### React Flow
Please go through the React Flow Documentation to get a good understanding of this library.

### MUI-5
We also use MUI-5 for the UI design in this project. You can refer to the MUI-5 documentation.

By getting comfortable with these topics, you should be able to get on board with this project relatively quickly.
